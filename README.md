'Even to the Post Office' is a line I stole from a wonderful old couple I met years ago. 
They had been married for 50 years and whenever one of them left the house - 
even on a minor errand such as posting a letter, they kissed the other one and said goodbye. 
For me the line 'Even to the Post Office' is a reminder that 
none of us know when you might lose someone suddenly without having the opportunity to say goodbye.
